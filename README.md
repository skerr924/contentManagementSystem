This is CMS which tracks employee data through an easy to use, node CLI. The application stores employee, department, and role data on an sql database, including information such as: employee name, salary, title, and department, as well as department and role information such as which roles belong to which departments. 

The user can perform simple functions through the inquirer prompts, including: view all employees, all roles, or all departments, delete an employee, update employee information like role or manager, etc.
